# Deep Learning Project
## Project Overview
SDAIA Bootcamp project 5 - Deep Learning. 

The main goal of this project is to classify the heart condition from the heart sound. Using neural network tools such as Keras, we built a neural network model with the appropriate use of layers to handle the heart sound recordings. The model was effective in classifying normal/abnormal heart conditions.
