# Deep Learning Project
## Project Overview
SDAIA Bootcamp project 5 - Deep Learning. 

The main goal of this project is to classify the heart condition from the heart sound. Using neural network tools such as Keras, we built multiple neural network modele with the appropriate use of layers to handle the heart sound recordings. The final model was effective in classifying normal/abnormal heart conditions.
